# For installing the Pi-Hole software :

One-Step Automated Install

Those who want to get started quickly and conveniently may install Pi-hole using the following command, although I would highly reccomend checking out the 
current pihole website to see the documentation and requirements.  (https://pi-hole.net/)

    curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
    
Alternative Install Methods

Piping to bash is controversial, as it prevents you from reading code that is about to run on your system. Therefore, we provide these alternative installation methods which allow code review before installation:
Method 1: Clone our repository and run

    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole
    cd "Pi-hole/automated install/"
    sudo bash basic-install.sh

Method 2: Manually download the installer and run

    wget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net
    sudo bash basic-install.sh

# I've also added the Pi-Hole tarball in the files.
